sqlpermcalc Support Tools
=========================

Support tools for the use of sqlpermcalc:

mysql_start_logging.sh
----------------------
Script to turn on logging for the local MySQL server. The logging is done to
tables. This is less efficient than file logging, but is far easier to parse.
Also just before logging is definitively enabled, existing logs are deleted so
that when the logs are retrieved they only contain logs that occurred from the
execution of this script onward. In addition, the Apache webserver is stopped
before logging is turned on and restarted after logging has been enabled. This
is to minimize (hopefully eliminate) any MySQL query activity for the target
web database.

Usage:
% mysql_start_logging.sh


mysql_stop_logging.sh
---------------------
Script to stop logging on the MySQL server. Query logging is typically
considered bad for performance so it isn't something you would usually want to
do on a production server long-term so this script turns off query logging.

Usage:
% mysql_stop_logging.sh


mysql_get_logfile.sh
--------------------
Script to retrieve all log entries for a given user from the MySQL query log
tables. You must supply a specific MySQL user account or you get a lot of
extraneous junk returned. These entries will be dumped to a file called
query_log_mysql.sql in the local directory.

Usage:
% mysql_get_logfile.sh <db_username>
